It is the oldest gathering of its kind, and the namesake of this summer event.'],

  ['2018 – 2020 · The Jatriwil era', 'The Empire of Jatriwil takes the hosting baton and runs with it. Exocraft drag races, sculpting contests, and PvP arenas become signature traditions — several of which still anchor the schedule today — as attendance climbs year over year across the hubs.'],

            <h2>Why summer?</h2>
            <p>
              For nine years UD has lived at the end of December — winter solstice, holiday season,
              an in-game new year. Beautiful, but <em>cold</em>. The community kept asking:{' '}
              <strong>why only once?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The in-game record gives us the answer. Long before our first UD, the Trade Lords
              assembled mid-year for what they called <strong>the Grand Festival</strong> — an
              extravaganza of gambling, GekNip, and fireworks. We've been re-running half of the
              tradition. It's time we ran the other half.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Summer Grand Festival is that other half. The end-of-year UD remains the
              canonical “main” event; this is its warmer, looser, more festival-coded sibling —
              and it has lore on its side.

              Unification Day has grown from a single December party into the largest fan-run

              almost every year. Here's the throughline, and where the Summer Grand Festival fits in.
