Seed the database with mock data extracted from the v0.9 mockup.

Runs idempotently — every INSERT is guarded by an existence check, so
calling this on every container boot is safe. The data here mirrors
the CIVS / PEOPLE / STORIES / INQUISITIONS JavaScript objects in
docs/v0.9-mockup.html so the live API can render the equivalent of
every mockup page.

Run as: `python -m app.seed`. The entrypoint.sh script runs this
after `alembic upgrade head`.

Edit-friendly notes:
- Add a new civ: append to CIVS list, run `python -m app.seed`.
- Same for people / stories / inquisitions.
- All cross-table joins are populated explicitly below.

The Postal System, in particular, addresses a long-standing gap in NMS social tooling: the ability to share visual representations of a player's discoveries without manual screenshot work.\n\n\"This is what we mean when we say workshop community,\" said Stars, the Haven's lead cartographer. \"We build things, we publish them, other civs use them. That's the loop.\"\n\nThe Keeper bot, in particular, has been in development across multiple iterations.

There was just code, and an idea: that the multiverse needed shared infrastructure.\n\nToday, the Haven runs five public-facing tools, with a sixth (this very archive) and a seventh (an internal economy) in active development. Every tool is free. Every tool is open to any civilization that wants to use it. And every tool was built with the same conviction: that the work matters more than the credit.\n\n> \"We don't claim systems we haven't visited. We don't write histories we can't source.

The Keeper bot ran in Voyager's Haven Discord without modification for several months, providing a thin layer of automation atop the community's growing membership.\n\nThen it broke.\n\nWhat exactly went wrong is, at this point, not entirely clear. The original codebase had been written quickly, and as the community grew, edge cases multiplied. The bot started missing message pinning. Role assignments occasionally failed silently. Eventually, the bot stopped responding to commands at all, and for a period of about three months, the Haven operated without it entirely.\n\nThis is the point at which Stars stepped in.",

The contention was about what to replace it with. Three competing proposals reached the floor at the Spring Summit, ranging from a relatively minor adjustment of the existing borders to a full re-architecture of the Hub's regional system.\n\nWhat ultimately won out was a compromise: three older Euclid regions would merge to address overlap problems, two Eissentam regions would split to address growth, and a corridor that had been informally called \"the Western Reach\" for over a year would be formally recognized.\n\nThis piece will be supplemented with additional reporting in the coming days as the new structure takes effect.",

The conflict escalated when route exclusivity claims overlapped in the Hub region.\n\nThe participation of the Federation of Allied Stars remains disputed — primary sources from FAS leadership deny direct involvement, but secondary accounts from independent traders place FAS members at multiple confrontations.\n\n**Open questions.** Date of first organized confrontation (sources vary by 4 months); casualty figures (in-game terms; no canonical count); role of the Atlas Foundation as mediator vs. participant.\n\n**This inquisition is in progress.** Findings are tentative and may change as research continues.",
