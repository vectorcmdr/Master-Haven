## Findings tracker

(Numbering follows the remediation prompt's phase-by-phase fix list, mapping back to V4 audit Section 3 / Section 4 / Section 5 where possible.)

| # | Title | Phase | Status | Files touched | Verified | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | /shop/ipo NameError 500 | 1 | done | page_routes.py | live: GET /shop/ipo→200 | module-level datetime+timedelta+timezone import; removed 9 local duplicates |
| 2 | No UI to approve pending shops | 1 | done | page_routes.py, mint/pending_shops.html, nation/pending_shops.html, mint/dashboard.html, dashboard.html, base.html | live: WM approves Alice's shop via /mint/shops/pending; Alice approves Bob's via /nation/shops/pending | new routes /mint/shops/pending, /nation/shops/pending + approve/reject; nav + dashboard cards added |
| 3 | Nation leader can self-approve own shop | 1 | done | shop_routes.py, page_routes.py | live: Alice POST /api/shops/2/approve→403; UI redirect with clear error | guards in approve_shop, reject_shop, suspend_shop and /nation/shops/{id}/approve |
| 4 | Helper for relational leader check | 2 | done | app/auth.py | live: imports work | added is_leader_of, get_led_nation in Phase 1 |
| 5 | Suspend nation demotes leader role | 2 | done | mint_routes.py, page_routes.py | live: alice citizen after suspend | preserves world_mint role; checks for other-led nations |
| 6 | Unsuspend re-promotes leader role | 2 | done | mint_routes.py, page_routes.py | live: alice nation_leader after unsuspend | new POST /api/mint/nations/{id}/unsuspend + page route |
| 7 | WM-as-leader access to /nation/* | 2 | done | page_routes.py | live: admin (WM) gets 200 on all 4 nation pages while leading Adminland | bulk-replaced 7 guard blocks via regex sub |
| 8 | Standardize role-check pattern | 2 | done | page_routes.py | grep -c found 0 occurrences after replace | get_led_nation is the canonical pattern; existing relational checks left as-is |
| 9 | Reject pending nation endpoint | 2 | done | mint_routes.py | live: API rejects, status=rejected | added POST /api/mint/nations/{id}/reject; page-route version pre-existed |
| 10 | Unsuspend nation endpoint | 2 | done | mint_routes.py, page_routes.py | (covered by fix 6) | API + page-route POST |
| 11 | Leadership-transfer flow | 2 | deferred-to-followup | — | — | needs design input |
| 12 | Validate user not already in nation on apply | 2 | done | page_routes.py | live: alice (member of Atlantia) gets "You already lead a nation" | also blocks citizens-of-other-nations from applying; rejected nation names re-usable |
| 13 | Hide "Open a Shop" CTA when ineligible | 3 | done | dashboard.html | live: bob (no nation) sees no Open a Shop button | wrapped CTA in `{% if user_nation and user_nation.status=='approved' %}` |
| 14 | Pending-nation user shouldn't see shop CTA | 3 | done | shop_manage.html, page_routes.py | live: carol (pending) sees "application is still pending" message | added user_pending_nation to base context |
| 15 | Suspended-nation leader navbar gate | 3 | done | base.html, page_routes.py | live: alice's nav has Treasury before/0 after suspend | navbar keys off user_led_nation (status=approved) |
| 16 | Approve/Reject buttons on /mint/nations | 3 | done | mint/nations.html | live: 2 Approve + 2 Restore buttons on /mint/nations | also added Suspend for approved + Restore for suspended |

| 18 | Block listing creation on pending shops | 3 | done | page_routes.py | live: bob's POST → "Your shop must be approved", listings table empty | guard in shop_listing_create_post + toggle_post |
| 19 | Pending-shop banner on /shop/manage | 3 | done | shop_manage.html | live: alert-info banner rendered for pending shop; listings form hidden | also rendered for rejected/suspended states |
| 20 | /loans/apply empty state by role | 3 | done | loan_apply.html | role-aware CTA wired (live test in Phase 6) | shows "Create a Bank" to leaders, "ask your nation leader" otherwise |
| 21 | /send max="0" poisoning | 4 | done | send.html | live: balance=0 user submits, max attr removed when balance=0 | drops max attr instead of poisoning at zero |
| 22 | Form input preservation across POST handlers | 4 | partial | send.html, nations_apply.html, shop_create.html, page_routes.py | live: /send, /nations/apply, /shop/create all preserve input on error | added _render_form_error helper; refactored 3 high-impact POST handlers; remaining (/banks/create, /loans/apply POST, /register, /login, exchange trade, distribute, ipo) NOT refactored — will use redirect+error pattern. Deferred to follow-up sweep. |
| 23 | Shop creation form too thin | 4 | done | shop_create.html, page_routes.py | live: resource_depot without mining_setup → inline error; with mining_setup → success | added shop_type select + conditional mining_setup textarea; smoke test #19/#20 still pass |
| 24 | CSRF tokens | 4 | deferred-to-followup | — | — | separate security pass |
| 25 | New-user onboarding banner | 5 | done | _partials/onboarding.html, dashboard.html, page_routes.py | live: eve sees Welcome banner, then pending banner, then nothing after approval | state machine in partial; is_new_user computed from created_at < 24h |

| 27 | Apply-for-Nation entry point | 5 | done | nations.html | live: "Don't see your community" banner on /nations for non-member users | hides for users with pending app or already in nation |
| 28 | Banks in navbar | 5 | done | base.html | live: /banks/nation/{id} link in nav for users with a nation | conditional on user_nation since no top-level /banks page exists |

| 30 | Distribute in navbar (leader-only) | 5 | done | base.html | live: /nation/distribute link in leader nav block | gated on user_led_nation |

| 32 | Mobile nav grouping | 7 | done (lite) | base.html, style.css | live: section labels render on mobile via data-label CSS | full collapsible details/summary refactor deferred — current pattern uses CSS-pseudo labels on `.nav-divider[data-label]`; works without JS |
| 33 | Sub-toggle pattern for sections | 7 | done (lite) | style.css | (covered by 32) | desktop unchanged, mobile shows section headers; expand/collapse JS deferred to follow-up |
| 34 | Breadcrumbs | 7 | done | base.html (block), style.css, nation/treasury.html, shop_manage.html, exchange_trade.html, bank_detail.html | live: breadcrumbs render on /shop/manage etc. | new `{% block breadcrumb %}` in base; 4 templates wired |

| 37 | Stop auto-dismissing errors | 8 | done | static/js/app.js | live test by triggering an error and waiting | guards added in initFlashMessages and showAlert; success/info still auto-dismiss |
| 38 | Standardize empty-state icons | 8 | partial | dashboard.html, style.css (existing) | one inline SVG converted as exemplar | shared `.empty-icon` class already standardizes size+opacity across templates; full SVG conversion of remaining 9 entity glyphs deferred to follow-up |
| 39 | Filter recent transactions on dashboard | 8 | done | page_routes.py, dashboard.html | live: BUY/SELL no longer in dashboard table | filter to TRANSFER/PURCHASE/DISTRIBUTE/MINT/GENESIS; "Stock activity" link added to portfolio |
| 40 | Quick Actions visual hierarchy | 8 | done | dashboard.html | live: Send is btn-lg, others btn-sm | Send promoted to its own row, others secondary row |
| 41 | Footer dynamic year | 8 | done | base.html, page_routes.py | live: footer reads © 2026 (current year from datetime.now()) | current_year added to _base_context |
| 42 | Logout fallback form | 8 | done | base.html, page_routes.py | live: POST /logout returns 303 to /login?success=Logged+out+successfully | new /logout page route + form-fallback in nav |
