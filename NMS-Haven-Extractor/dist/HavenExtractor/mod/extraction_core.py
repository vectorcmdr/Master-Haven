"""
extraction_core.py - Pure data-transform logic for the Haven Extractor.

This module deliberately imports NOTHING from pymhf / nmspy / the game. Everything
here is a pure function of its inputs, so it can be unit/smoke-tested outside the
game (where pymhf is unavailable). haven_extractor.py reads game memory and feeds
the resulting plain dicts into these functions to build the upload payload.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The batch data-loss bug came from the mod *re-reading live game memory* when it
finalized a system it had already left. No Man's Sky reuses a single solar-system
object, so once you warp away the old memory holds the *next* system. The fix is to
capture each system's data while it is live, stash it in plain dicts, and then build
the payload from those dicts via the PURE functions below - never touching live
memory at finalize time. Because these functions are pure, a frozen dict cannot be
mutated by a later warp, which is exactly the property the smoke test verifies.

    Rules:
      1. Drop candidates that failed to read (None) or are out of range (not 0..255).

         evidence of a real non-Euclid galaxy. Prefer the value that the most sources
         agree on; tie-break by trust order.

      4. If NO candidate survived, return (None, "unknown"). The caller must treat this
         as "galaxy unknown" and must NOT fall back to Euclid.
